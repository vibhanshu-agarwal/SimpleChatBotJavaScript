<p>Any information you want to use in JavaScript has a <strong>type</strong>. The<strong> </strong>type describes what kind of data is stored in memory and what operations apply to it.</p><p>Let's draw an analogy. Types can be understood by looking at animal species or other common attributes of a group of objects. All kittens and tomcats are cats, but each is a separate object. Thinking of cats as a type, you can assume some operations are available; for example, a cat can purr.</p><p>In this topic, we will consider two simple data types popular in programming.</p><h5 id="strings">Strings</h5><p>You will have to use <code class="language-javascript">strings</code> when working with textual information in your program. This type of data is widespread in JavaScript. Strings are written in single or double quotes.</p><ul><li><p>Examples of strings in double quotes:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log("");             // the empty string
console.log("string");       // one word
console.log("Hello, world"); // a phrase</code></pre><ul><li><p>Examples of strings in single quotes:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log('a');    // a single character
console.log('1234'); // a sequence of digits</code></pre><div class="alert alert-warning"><p>Note that any digits in quotes are also considered a string.</p></div><p>As you can see, strings are easy to use!</p><h5 id="numbers">Numbers</h5><p><strong>Numbers</strong> are the most important data type for any programmer. You can't write a serious program without numbers, so let's see how to output a number to the console:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(12);
console.log(0); 
console.log(-11); 
console.log(-1.04); </code></pre><p>You can use positive, negative numbers, and zero. There are no additional difficulties in recording floating-point numbers.</p><p>Integer numbers can count physical objects, while floating-point numbers are good for statistical and scientific calculations.</p><h5 id="the-typeof-operator">The<em> </em><code class="language-javascript">typeof</code> operator</h5><p>We can easily recognize a data type using the <code class="language-javascript">typeof</code> operator. Let's look at two examples where we output the data type to the console.</p><p>There are two ways to use the <code class="language-javascript">typeof</code> operator.</p><ul><li><p>With parentheses:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(typeof(9)); // number</code></pre><ul><li><p>Without parentheses:</p></li></ul><pre><code class="language-javascript">console.log(typeof 9); // number</code></pre><p>The result of these two code samples is the same. We want to find out what type of data <code class="language-javascript">9</code> is, and it turns out to be a <code class="language-javascript">number</code>.</p><p>This operator is handy when working with different data types since JavaScript can automatically convert data types to each other. We will discuss this feature in the following topics.</p><p>Read more on this topic in <a href="https://hyperskill.org/blog/post/string-along-with-javascript-strings#string-methods" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">String Along with JavaScript Strings</a> on the Hyperskill Blog.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>A data<strong> </strong>type describes how to store data in memory and which operations apply to the data. In this topic, we've looked at two simple data types: <code class="language-javascript">strings</code> and <code class="language-javascript">numbers</code>. Strings store textual information in a program, while numbers are used for numeric values. We have also explored the <code class="language-javascript">typeof</code> operator, which you can use to check the data type of a variable.</p>
