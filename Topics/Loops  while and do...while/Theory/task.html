<p>Before delving into this topic, you might have made yourself a cup of coffee to sip it as you read. In the meantime, the weather conditions outside might be changing; it may have started raining after a cloudy morning. As it rains, the pavements become wet, and puddles grow. All these scenarios, based on the <code class="language-javascript">while</code> ... (condition) structure, illustrate the concept of loops.</p>
<p>A loop is a segment of code that repeats a specified number of times. <code class="language-javascript">While</code> loops continue as long as a certain condition remains true, like <em>while you are reading the topic</em> or <em>while</em> <em>it is raining</em>. Some conditions are always true. For example, if you write <code class="language-javascript">while (5 &lt; 6)</code>, this results in an infinite loop, as <code class="language-javascript">5</code> is perennially less than <code class="language-javascript">6</code>. Conversely, other conditions lead to a finite number of loop iterations.</p>
<h5 id="while-syntax">While syntax</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-javascript">while</code> loop takes the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">while (condition) {
...
}</code></pre>
<p>This loop runs as long as the <code class="language-javascript">condition == true</code>. Once the stated condition turns <code class="language-javascript">false</code>, the loop terminates.</p>
<p>Check out the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let n = 2;
while (n &lt; 100) {
    n = n * n;
    console.log(n);
}</code></pre>
<p>Ultimately, we get this result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">4
16
256</code></pre>
<p>How did this happen? Let's go through each iteration step by step.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the variable <code class="language-javascript">n = 2</code>. We immediately check if <code class="language-javascript">n &lt; 100</code> upon entering the while loop. This condition is true, which brings us into the loop. Next, we square <code class="language-javascript">n</code> and output the result, which is why we get <code class="language-javascript">4</code> on the first line.</p>
<p>In the second iteration, we check the condition before running the loop. <code class="language-javascript">4 * 4 = 16</code>: that's the second line. As <code class="language-javascript">16 &lt; 100</code> is true, we execute the loop for the third time, multiplying <code class="language-javascript">16</code> by itself to get <code class="language-javascript">256</code>. However, before we start the loop for the fourth time, we see that <code class="language-javascript">256</code> is no longer less than <code class="language-javascript">100</code>, bringing an end to the loop.</p>
<h5 id="dowhile-syntax">Do...while syntax</h5>
<p>There is another kind of loop that continues as long as the conditions are correct: the <code class="language-javascript">do...while</code> loop. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">do {
...
} while (condition);</code></pre>
<p>The previous example can be rephrased using the <code class="language-javascript">do...while</code> structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let n = 2;
do {
    n = n * n;
    console.log(n);
} while (n &lt; 100);</code></pre>
<p>It's easy to see that the output will be the same as the one from <code class="language-javascript">while</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">4
16
256</code></pre>
<p>So, what separates these two, and why do we need two types of loops providing the same result?</p>
<h5 id="while-vs-dowhile">While vs. do...while</h5>
<p>There's indeed a difference. The following example will clarify it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let n = 256;
while (n &lt; 100) {
    n = n * n;
    console.log(n);
}</code></pre>
<p>What will be the output? None. The loop only starts if the condition is <code class="language-javascript">true</code>. So, what happens with <code class="language-javascript">do...while</code>?</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">let n = 256;
do {
    n = n * n;
    console.log(n);
} while (n &lt; 100);</code></pre>
<p>You'll find that the console displays <code class="language-javascript">65536</code>!</p>
<p>The difference lies in when the check occurs. With <code class="language-javascript">do...while</code>, the condition evaluation happens after executing the first iteration. This means the loop will run at least once, even if the initial condition is false.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>This topic has introduced the concept of <code class="language-javascript">while</code> loops in programming. We have explored two types of loops, namely <code class="language-javascript">while</code> and <code class="language-javascript">do...while</code>, and highlighted their differences. We have also learned that a perpetual true condition can lead to an infinite loop. Overall, loops are an essential part of programming and are crucial in executing repeated code blocks efficiently. With this knowledge, you can apply your knowledge and challenge yourself to create more complex programs using loops.</p>
<p>Always remember the conditions that will lead to a successful loop execution.</p>
